1. Repository Pattern
	When data source chages - there is problem for whole application
	
		during development  - we are useing InMemory Collection (List) - application is created well - works well
		during production - after 3 months - lets use SQL Server database (SQL server free tiral edition - 6 months)
		after another 5 months - we said Orcle licence is chepear than sql server
		later we want to switch to NoSQL database - MongoDB

		we had model, view, controller everything being designed accordingly
		and thus all of this will need some or some changes

		however, if we use Reposititory pattern, we do not have to make change to any of the part of application
