			ASP.Net WebAPI

wea had SOAP based Web Services - useing XML Schema for data communication and cross platform apps

SOAP became very heavy and slow for todays internet connections

Thus we wanted a light weight and super fast data format,cross platform - JSON was inrtroduced

-------------------
SOAP - web services - was not based on HTTP protocol standards

But today comapred to 200-2005 - internet has evolved to a very huge extend

 
-------------------------------
Thus W3C - World wide web consorium - laid the standards - REST 
Representational State Transfer - talks about transfer of data, read the data from network
				serialialize and deserialize the data 

------------------------------
Microsoft studied this sandards, created classes, methods, properties, compoilers, Attributes, framework for developers and called it
as WebAPI - ASP.Net Web API 




Web API - 
	This is a service - for data communication - No UI no backend - like in MVC - u will have Contoller and model no view
	This is a Middle ware of your project
	.Net API Developer - Develop WebAPI (C#) 
		            Consume WebAPI (Javascript / C#)


-------------
	WebAPI methods will have IActionResult as a return type (all the methods)
	and it will return HttpStatus Code

	there is no such location - what do you get  ? 404 - Page not round
	there is a code for Get, Put, Post, delete, error, security etc...

	HttpVerbs used in WEbAPI 
		Get - when user wants to get something from the server (data, image, video etc....)
		Put - When user wants to update anything
		Delete  - when user wasnts to delete something 
		Post - when user wants to Add a new resource 

		To test webapi - we need some tools
			Postman (needs to be downloaded and installed for WebaPI 5.0 and below)
			Fiddler (needs to be downloaded and installed for WebaPI 5.0 and below)
			Swagger (inbuilt with .net core 6.0)
			
		This tools can perform GET, PUT, POST and Delete methods
		U can test GET part in browser throught browser address
		but for Post, put and delete u need to create an HTML form
